## Project Overview

PAI AeroNews will automatically aggregate your aerospace newsletter emails and display them in a scrolling news ticker on your Squarespace website.

**Architecture:**
```
Your Outlook → Auto-forward → Gmail
                                ↓
                    Google Apps Script (hourly)
                                ↓
                         Google Sheet
                                ↓
                    GitHub Action (fetches data)
                                ↓
                    GitHub Pages (serves HTML)
                                ↓
                    Squarespace iframe

## What Claude Will Do (When You Return)

Once you've completed the above steps, Claude will:

1. **Create the Google Apps Script** - Newsletter-specific email parsing
2. **Update fetch-news.js** - Read from Google Sheet instead of NewsAPI
3. **Update GitHub workflow** - Remove API key requirements
4. **Update documentation** - Reflect new architecture

---

## When You Return (Checklist)

When you're back on Friday 2/6/26 (or later):

- [ ] Confirm Gmail account created
- [ ] Confirm Outlook forwarding rules set up
- [ ] Confirm Gmail label "AeroNews" created
- [ ] Confirm Gmail filter created
- [ ] Test: Forward a newsletter manually, check it appears in Gmail with label
- [ ] Tell Claude "Let's continue with PAI AeroNews setup"

## Future Option: Power Automate

If you later want to try Microsoft Power Automate instead:
- No email forwarding needed (works directly with Outlook)
- Instant updates (vs hourly with Gmail)
- 750 runs/month free (sufficient for 8 newsletters)
- Can be set up as v2 after Gmail version is working
